	  <pr>ITB is a top college which gives amazing oppurtunites to all students involved. My course is Creative Digital Media and I find it to be a challenging yet very rewarding course. Not only am I learning some amazing skills for the future, but they are taught in a very professional way by the amazing lecturers. My favourite is Helen, my web design lecturer. She is very kind and does her best to inspire all students in her module to perform to the best of their ability.</pr>

	  <pr>I have worked in ITB for over 15 years and I do not have a single bad word to say about the experience. I teach engineering to 3rd and 4th year students and my eagerness to teach has not dulled in the slightest. ITB is a fun work place with an amazing complex and fabulous facilities. As I have been here for so long, I have seen the evolution of the college, as more and more blocks are built and the college expands. It is amazing to see how far we have come from the single block back in 1999 to multiple buildings we have no, and another on the way! </pr>
